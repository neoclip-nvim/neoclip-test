I tried to test the homebrew builds of neoclip. But it didn't work out. The obstacle is support of `clipboard` feature in nvim, which runs in the environment of github actions.

Another take was to make tests using nixOS test framework. It didn't work out either, so far. Those experiments are in the [neoclip-nvim/neoclip-flake](https://github.com/neoclip-nvim/neoclip-flake) repository
